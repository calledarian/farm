      <button class="accordion">1. How will my donation be used?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Your donation will help support our farm's sustainability efforts,
          including buying seeds, maintaining eco-friendly equipment, expanding
          farming practices, and covering the costs of artificial insemination
          and vaccinations for our livestock. It will also create job
          opportunities for local people, support ecological restoration, and
          help improve our food systems.
        </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">2. What impact will my donation make?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Your donation will have a significant impact by allowing us to drive
          this project forward at a faster pace. It will help fund essential
          initiatives, such as sustainable farming practices, Bible Education
          Centers, and community support programs, enabling us to make a lasting
          difference in Cambodia and beyond.

        3. What are the long-term goals of the project?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The long-term goals of our project are to create a self-sustaining
          farm that provides support to the local community through sustainable
          farming practices. We aim to fund and build Bible Education Centers,
          create job opportunities for locals, and develop a space for Bible
          school events. Once we start earning money, we also hope to extend our
          support to other countries. Ultimately, we strive to strengthen the
          work of preaching in Cambodia and promote long-lasting, positive
          change for the community.

        4. Can I donate in different ways (e.g., monthly, in-kind,
        volunteering)?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Yes, there are several ways you can contribute to our mission! You can
          donate monthly, offer in-kind donations, or volunteer your time.
          Volunteers can stay at the farm and teach the locals the Bible, or
          help with farm improvements. Every form of support makes a big
          difference, and we are grateful for your involvement!
